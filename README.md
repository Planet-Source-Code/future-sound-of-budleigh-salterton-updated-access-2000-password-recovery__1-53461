## Updated Access 2000 password recovery


</div>

### Description

Recovers the password from Access 2000 databases. The problem of every other character being returned is fixed. This problem was caused by the creation date of the database having changed since it was originally created, probably by being copied.
 
### More Info
 
May change the system clock or slow it. Sorry!!!
